# BubbleSorter

Still a work in progress

At the moment it works as follows:

In App tab, if you Click run the following happens:

1. App will ask how many numbers you wish to sort
2. Input the number and it will display the following:
   1. "Before Sorting - [6,5,4,3,2,1]"
   2. "BubbleSorter - [1,2,3,4,5,6]"
   3. "MergeSorter - [1,2,3,4,5,6"


Problems for me to work on:
1. When building the Inputter, I can't split out the functions and get it to work, will work on it this weekend
2. MergeSorter Result keeps showing extra lines!!
3. Still can't get AppTest to work with input of Int[]
4. Build Binary Tree Sort
5. Build MVC  design patterns, ie. Display Manager and Sort Manager
6. Build Factory Pattern Design
7. Loggers
8. Timing Information
